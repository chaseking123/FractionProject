# FractionProject

 A program to sort a list of fractions (or integers) in ascending order, as well as calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the entire list.

    To run: 
    1. run makefile "make" while in the same folder as FractionProgram.cpp, Fraction.cpp, and Fraction.h to create FractionProgram.out if it isn't already in folder or needs to be re-compiled
    2. then run "./FractionProgram.out nameOfFile.txt" where nameOfFile.txt is the name of the file within the folder of fractions to be used (I have provided a few small test.txt inputs)

    Program takes a file of numbers/fractions in the following forms separated by spaces or newline:
    1, 1.1, 1_1/2, 1/2

    The console output is in the following form:
    
    The sum of the sorted fractions is: 32_5791/10710
    The difference of the fractions is: -52_5791/10710
    The product of the fractions is: -7228_51812/83521
    The quotient of the fractions is: -83521/6037416
    -10_0/1
    7/17
    9/17
    9/17
    1_3/17
    1_2/9
    2_4/7
    10_0/1
    12_1/10
    14_0/1
